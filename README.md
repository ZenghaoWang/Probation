# Probation Team
This game was made by the probation team. You can register/login with a username and password. There are three games to select from: A trivia game, a timing game and a tapping game.

In the trivia game, you can select from different categories of questions, or you can choose to play through all the questions.

In the timing game, your objective is to destroy as many enemy ships as possible. You shoot bullets by tapping the screen when the cursor is in the target area (The bold zone). If you miss, the enemies are alerted and they will shoot you! After you reach the boss ship, you will be rewarded with the option of upgrading your ship, and continue to fight stronger enemies. The game ends once you're out of HP or have defeated 30 enemies.

In the tapping game, your objective is to hit as many moles as you can. There are three different types of moles: A bomb mole, which will cause you to lose points, a regular mole which grants you a point for each tap, and a king mole which will grant you 5 points for each tap. You can tap them as fast as you want for additional points! There's also a hidden secret in the game if you're lucky enough!

The game ends once 30 normal moles have showed up.

## Setup
